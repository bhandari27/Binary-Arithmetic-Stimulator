# Binary Arithmetic Simulator  

This project is a **Binary Arithmetic Simulator** that performs arithmetic operations directly in binary form. It highlights bitwise logic, number representation, and binary computation.  

## Features  
- Binary addition and subtraction  
- Multiplication and division in binary  
- Conversion between decimal and binary  
- Step-by-step simulation of bitwise operations  

## Tech Stack  
- Language: C++ (or specify Python/Assembly if thatâ€™s what you used)  
- Concepts: bitwise operators, binary number systems, low-level arithmetic
